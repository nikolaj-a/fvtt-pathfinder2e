# fvtt-pathfinder2e
Pathfinder Second Edition game system for Foundry VTT.

## Getting started with development
Rename the `foundry.config.example.js` file to `foundry.config.js`, and change
the path to the Foundry Data folder in that file.

Run `npm install` once to fetch all dependencies and then `npm run start` to
build and watch for changes. You can then start Foundry or force reload your
world to try out the changes.
